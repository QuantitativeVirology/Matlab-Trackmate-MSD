# Matlab-Trackmate-MSD
This Matlab script allows quick batch analysis of Trackmate data with the MSD analyzer class.

The Read_Trackmate_xml_MSD_analyzer script is a batch processing focused tool to analyze large amounts of tracking data from the FIJI plugin Trackmate with the
matlab class MSDanalyzer. 

The Fast_large_Trackmate_xml_reader.m function is required  for the Read_Trackmate_xml_MSD_analyzer script. It allows for quick loading of the xml files Trackmate creates.


Both Trackmate and MSDanalyzer are required to use this script.
